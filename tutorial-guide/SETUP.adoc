An Inventory of Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section we will go through how to acquire and use the following
tools, which will be necessary for developing Errai and following along
with the rest of the tutorial:

* JDK (6 or 7)
* Maven (3.x)
* Wildfly 8 (Optional -- necessary for production, but not development mode)
* Eclipse IDE (with the M2E plugin)

Although it is possible to use counterparts for some of these tools, we
encourage you to use the suggested tools on your first go.

JDK
~~~

We recommend you use a version 7 of the Oracle JDK or the OpenJDK.

You can find Oracle's JDK
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here].

You can find instructions for installing the OpenJDK on several Linux
distributions
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[here].

Maven
~~~~~

Maven is a dependency management tool that we will use to build our
Errai Application. In order to install and use Maven, you will need to
have the JDK installed. It's important to make sure you have version 3
installed. Run `mvn --version` on the command line to check.

Go http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[here] to download the latest
version of Maven and follow the
http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi#Installation_Instructions[installation
instructions].

Wildfly
~~~~~~~

Wildlfy is an Application Server which we will use to host our Errai
Application locally. In the tutorial we will be using
Wildfly 8.1.0.Final.

You can download a zip file with Wildfly 8 
http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/8.1.0.Final/wildfly-8.1.0.Final.zip[here].
No installation is necessary. Simply unzip it to wherever you would like
the application's directory to be located.

Eclipse IDE with the M2E Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eclipse is an Integrated Development Environment that you can use to
develop an Errai Application. It is not necessary to use Eclipse for
development, but specific features of Eclipse will be used in parts of
this tutorial. The M2E plugin adds support for Maven integration with
Eclipse.

If you do not have Eclipse, you can find a version of Eclipse Kepler
with the M2E plugin
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr1[here].

If you already have Eclipse installed but do not have the M2E plugin,
you can find it in the Eclipse Marketplace (Help > Eclipse Marketplace)
by searching for "Maven Integration" or by going
http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/maven-integration-eclipse-juno-and-newer[here]
and dragging the "install" link into your running instance of Eclipse.

What's Next?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you have everything installed, you're ready to try running an
Errai Application locally. To find out how, go to the link:RUN.adoc[next
section].
