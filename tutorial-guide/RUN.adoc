== Running Errai

This section of the tutorial will show you how to deploy an Errai
Application locally for development. By the end of this section you will
be able to run the errai-tutorial demo in production mode.

=== Prerequisites

Before attempting this you should have installed all the necessary
software. For a list of required software with links and instructions,
check out the link:SETUP.adoc[setup section].

=== Regarding Commands

Any commands in these instructions are targeted towards users of
Unix-based operating systems (namely Linux and Mac OSX). If you are a
Windows user, the commands shown may need to be modified to work as
described. (Please consider enhancing these instructions by submitting a
https://github.com/errai/errai-tutorial[pull request] or starting a
discussion on the https://community.jboss.org/en/errai[forum].)

=== Getting Started

As mentioned above, we will be working with the errai-tutorial demo. So
the first thing we need to do is get a copy of the project. If you have
git installed on your computer, to clone the errai-tutorial project run

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
git clone https://github.com/errai/errai-tutorial.git $HOME/errai-tutorial
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have git, you can download the zip file
https://github.com/errai/errai-tutorial/archive/dev-mode.zip[here].

You should now have a folder `errai-tutorial` in your home directory.

=== Maven Project Structure

For those new to Maven, here's a quick overview of the project structure
in errai-tutorial:

* *pom.xml*
** This XML file contains all the dependency and plugin information
required for Maven to build this project.
* *src/main/java*
** The root folder for Java source code.
* *src/main/resources*
** The location of resources to be available to be provided to the
application at run time. This folder contains configurations used by
Errai.
* *src/main/webapp*
** The location of html and css files, and any other resources to be
served to clients.

=== Starting Wildfly

To run this demo, we'll be deploying it to the Wildfly Application Server.
To start a standalone instance of Wildfly, run

----------------------------------------
$WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
----------------------------------------

where `$WILDFLY_HOME` is the path to Wildfly folder you unzipped from the
link:SETUP.adoc[setup] instructions.

Now go to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser. If the server is
running correctly, you should see a Wildfly welcome page.

=== Building and Deploying

It's time to really get things started. While the Wildfly server is still
running, run the command

---------------------------------
mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
---------------------------------

*Note*: This command may take a while the first time it is executed.
This is because Maven must fetch all the dependencies required to
compile the project. This is only necessary the first time you build,
making subsequent builds much faster.

=== For Other Application Servers

If you are using a different Application Server you should be able to
manually deploy the demo by running

-----------------
mvn clean package
-----------------

and then copying `$HOME/errai-tutorial/target/errai-tutorial.war` to the
proper deployments folder.

[[verify-deployment]]
=== Verify Deployment

Once Maven is done building and deploying the demo, verify that it is
running at http://localhost:8080/errai-tutorial . This demo features a
simple complaint form application. Users can submit complaints from the
main page, and view submitted complaints from an administrative page
(linked at the bottom of the home page). See link:../README.md[README] for more 
details.

To really see the demo in action, you should run it with at
least two browser windows open. Try submitting complaints with one
window and see them live update to the admin screen. Or open two admin
windows and completing complaints.

*Note*: By default, Wildfly will only serve the application locally. If
you would like to try the demo on multiple devices, you can configure
Wildfly to bind to all addresses by editing
`$WILDFLY_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`. Take just these lines:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
<interface name="public">
   <inet-address value="${jboss.bind.address.public:127.0.0.1}"/>
</interface>
-----------------------------------------------------------------

And replace them with this:

-------------------------
<interface name="public">
    <any-address/>
</interface>
-------------------------

=== Build and deploy as native app to your mobile device

The native application will have to know the absolute path to your 
server or cluster. For this demo you will have to change the REST 
and Errai Bus endpoint URL in Config.java and App.java (see comments) 
before building the native application. Make sure that your application
server instance is bound to an IP address that can be reached from your 
mobile device. The section <<verify-deployment, Verify Deployment>> 
desribes how to change the binding address of Wildfly AS.

To produce the native applications run:

----
% mvn clean package -Pmobile,jboss7
----

After that you can simply install the native app on your phone or tablet.

Note that you will need to enable development options on your device and 
have the Android SDK installed on your local machine.

For deploying the native application to your Android device simply execute:
----
% adb install target/template/platforms/android/bin/HelloCordova-debug.apk
----
