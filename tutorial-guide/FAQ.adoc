== Dev Mode Questions

=== Changes in standalone.xml don't seem to work in Dev Mode. What gives?
By default, the Jboss/Wildfly instance is started using a copy of `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.
This is done because remote debugging of the AS requires configurations in addition to those found in `standalone.xml`.

=== How can I specify a different configuration file for Jboss/Wildfly?
In your pom.xml add the following to the `extraJvmArgs` in the gwt-maven-plugin configuration:

-----------------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.config.file=$CONFIG_FILE
-----------------------------------------

`$CONFIG_FILE` must be the name (*without* any parent directories) of a file in `$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration`.

=== How can I pass other options to the JVM running Jboss/Wildfly?
In your pom.xml add the following to the `extraJvmArgs` in the gwt-maven-plugin configuration (where `$JAVA_OPTS` is the string of options):

-----------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.javaopts=$JAVA_OPTS
-----------------------------------

=== How do I change the port for remote debugging Jboss/Wildfly?
In your pom.xml add the following to the `extraJvmArgs` in the gwt-maven-plugin configuration (where `$PORT` is the desired port number):

------------------------------
-Derrai.jboss.debug.port=$PORT
------------------------------

=== Can I use my own instance of Jboss/Wildfly instead of the one provided?
Absolutely. If your project is based off of the errai-tutorial project, there are only two steps:
* Set the `errai.jboss.home` property at the top of the pom.xml to the absolute path of your `$WILDFLY_HOME`
* In the plugins tag in the pom.xml, remove the maven-dependency-plugin configuration
The Dev Mode launcher will now start the Wildfly instance located at `$WILDFLY_HOME`.
